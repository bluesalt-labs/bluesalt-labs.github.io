My name is Luke, AKA BlueSalt Labs. For those of you who understand what the title of this post is referencing, I hope you can appreciate why I chose it. For those of you who don't, please click here: ["Hello, World!" program - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program){:target='_blank'}

The story of why I started BlueSalt Labs is a bit long, and it's not really important anymore. The current purpose is a little different: I have many coding-related ideas and passions, and BlueSalt Labs will become the outlet for that passion. However, this whole thing will be a huge learning experience, and I'm just getting started.

# Company Name

To explain why I chose the name BlueSalt Labs, I will break down each part of the name.

### Blue

The color blue represents inspiration, imagination, freedom, intelligence, and depth, among many other things. I aim to emulate these traits in my code.

### Salt

Salt has been has many different uses: it adds flavor to food, it's a preservative and disinfectant, it's been used as currency, etc. etc. The point is that it's everywhere and it's valuable. Code has many of these same properties.

### BlueSalt

Blue salt, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcanthite" target="_blank">Chalcanthite</a> is a unique type of salt. The fact that this type of salt exists was a coincidence, but the more I read about it, the more I liked the coincidence. This only further solidified (crystallized?) my name choice.

### Labs

Besides sounding awesome, a lab (i.e. laboratory) is a place for research, testing, production, and other scientific activities. It implies a clean, organized environment. I aim to emulate these traits in my work in general.

## Company Logo

The choice in logo should be relatively obvious, but for those interested, here is the original sketch:

<img class="img-responsive" src="/resources/images/uploads/2016/03/bsl-logo-sketch.jpg" alt="bsl-logo-sketch" />

The letters BSL are actually in the logo. It's alright if you can't see it; this was more of a failed easter egg than anything else.

I will attempt to write one of these posts at least once a month and as I have more to say, twice a month. This journey should be a lot of fun, so stick around!
